1. Get Coordinates for each city in JSON
    1.1. Will use the unstructured way with q as the names in the list given are not all of same nature not all cities, nor departments etc. 
        For example, 
            Ariège: It's a department and a river, not a specific town.
            Gorges du Verdon: It's a natural canyon, not a municipality.
        After checks, these names are unique; there are no duplicates.

2. Get API CRED OPENWEATHER & check API possibility BOOKING
    2.1 Openweather : Put in DF - Call 16 day / daily forecast data / USE : api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&cnt={cnt}&appid={API key}
    2.2 Booking : CSS / API is not free (need to insert payment methods)
3. SCRAP OPENWEATHER DATA with API
4. SCRAP BOOKING CSS

================================================================================================


1. Customers need more info about destination they are going to (after buy perhaps)
2. They need to know the brand that produced the content (if not they are defiant)
3. KAYAK wants to create an recommendation APP where ppl plan next holidays.
    3.a. Based on Weather (Openweather API easy)
    3.b. Based on Hotels info (annex 2) in the area (Booking scrapping / API if there is)
    3.c. Should be available at any given time (A-Z availability ?)

4. GOALS/STEPS 🚩 : 
    4.1. Scrape data from destinations (annex 1)
    4.2.  ↘️ Get weather data API & hotels info API
    4.3. Store all data/infos in a data lake (S3) as CS FILE
    4.4. ETL it from datalake S3 to data warehouse RDS

5. Deliverable 📬 :
    5.1. To complete this project, your team should deliver:
    5.2. A .csv file in an S3 bucket containing enriched information about weather and hotels for each french city
    5.3. A SQL Database where we should be able to get the same cleaned data from S3
    5.4. Two maps where you should have a Top-5 destinations and a Top-20 hotels in the area. 
        You can use plotly or any other library to do so. It should look something like this:
